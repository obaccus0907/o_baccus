Question1

In this case we have two populations, a population with white sounding names, and a population with black sounding names. We would like to determine whether the proportion callback for each population is equal (no racism), or not. CLT applies in this case. We know that the central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population *with replacement*, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed. This will hold true regardless of whether the source population is normal or skewed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (usually n > 30), and it is in this case, considering we are sampling the data from America. We also know that the samples must be independent, and in this case, white sounding names and black sounding names were assigned randomly. 

Question2

The null hypothesis is that the mean call back of black and white sounding names are equal. The alternate hypothesis is that white sounding names have a mean call back that is not equal to that of black sounding names. 

Question3

Using a two sample t test of sample size 1000, we observe a small p value of 0.008 which means we are likely to reject the null hypothesis that the mean callback of black and white sounding names are equal.

Question4, Question5

The t-test showed us, due to a low p-value, that we can, with confidence, reject the null hypothesis that the call back rate of white and black sounding names are the same. This tells us that a person's race has an effect on the likelihood of them being employed or not, in this analysis. However, it is important, for a more wholesome approach to take into account other factors that might have an impact on a person's employability before assuming that it is race and only race that is a main factor determinant.
