Part A

The rate of admissions does seem to be trending down. The trend line shows a slightly negative slope. We confirm point 1 of A.
After isolating the scatter plot for areas where the excess readmissions were high and the discharges were low, we note that there is still a negative trend line, so we can confirm with point 2 of A. 
After isolating the scatter again, for the opposite values, we note that the negative trend line persists and therefore can confirm point 3 of part A. 

Part B

We can confirm that part B is accurate after isolating the dataframe depending on the number of discharges in question and determinig the means of the excess readmission rates as well as the percentage of the dataframe with readmission rates greater than one.

Part C

After plotting the data, we see that there is a negative correlation equal to -0.1 between discharges and readmission rates which is not significant, yet, not negligible. "Smaller hospitals/facilities may be lacking necessary resources to ensure quality care and prevent complications that lead to readmissions." This seems plausible, although to confirm, we would need access to data on hospital sizes and compare (based on patient intake, resources etc). 


Part D

"Hospitals/facilties with small capacity (< 300) should be required to demonstrate upgraded resource allocation for quality care to continue operation." This is a complicated approach and might prove to be costly from a business perspective on smaller hospitals who already struggle with resources and funding. The readmission rate for hospitals with a capacity of below 300 is approximately 54%. By that logic, all hospital will not be allowed to continue operation due to their lacking of quality care. 

"Directives and incentives should be provided for consolidation of hospitals and facilities to have a smaller number of them with higher capacity and number of discharges." This would only make sense if the ultimate benefit it allocated to the hospital. A consolidation of hospitals does not necessarily mean higher quality care and therefore, lower readmission rates. Instead, incentives should be provided to hospitals to focus on quality care (whether through financial incentives or others), and reducing the readmission rate. 


My Recommendation

Using the original dataset with access to state data, I would like to study whether there is a difference (significant) in readmission rates across different states. In this analysis, I isolated the dataframe in order to display the top 5 states and bottom 5 states of the dataframe based on their mean re-admission rates. After plotting this data, I now test the null hypothesis that the mean of one of the top states and one of the bottom states are equal. It is fair to say (noting the low p value) that we can reject the null hypothesis with confidence, and therefore we can say that the readmission rates across states are significantly different.We can study the swarmplot and see the difference between Idaho and NJ in terms of the distribution of observations according to their readmission rates.
